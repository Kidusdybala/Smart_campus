##  Machine Learning Integration

<div align="center">

###  AI-Powered Smart Campus Intelligence

**Revolutionary ML-driven recommendations that learn from user behavior**

</div>

###  ML-Powered Recommendation Engines

####  Intelligent Food Recommendation System

The system employs **sophisticated machine learning algorithms** to provide personalized food recommendations:

**Core Algorithms:**
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find similar users
- **Time-Weighted Analysis**: Applies exponential decay to recent orders (30-day half-life)
- **Hybrid Recommendation System**: Combines collaborative and personal history approaches
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures user similarity for better matching

**Technical Implementation:**
```python
class RecommendationEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.food_knn_model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5, metric='cosine')
        self.food_scaler = StandardScaler()

    def train_collaborative_filtering(self, orders):
        # Create user-item interaction matrix
        # Apply collaborative filtering with KNN
        # Train on historical order data
        pass

    def get_personal_recommendations(self, user_id, orders):
        # Analyze user's order history
        # Apply time-weighted scoring
        # Generate personalized suggestions
        pass
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Real-time Learning**: Updates recommendations based on new orders
- ✅ **Fallback System**: Provides mock data when MongoDB is unavailable
- ✅ **Adaptive Scoring**: Adjusts recommendations based on user feedback
- ✅ **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers order frequency, recency, and trends

####  Smart Parking Recommendation Engine

**AI-driven parking spot optimization using behavioral pattern recognition:**

**ML Algorithms Used:**
- **Frequency Analysis**: Tracks most-used parking spots per user
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies usage patterns and preferences
- **Historical Data Mining**: Analyzes past reservations and occupancy
- **Predictive Modeling**: Suggests optimal spots based on time and availability

**Technical Architecture:**
```python
def analyze_parking_patterns(user_id, reservations):
    # Calculate parking frequency per spot
    parking_freq = {}
    for reservation in reservations:
        spot = reservation.get('slot')
        parking_freq[spot] = parking_freq.get(spot, 0) + 1

    # Sort by frequency and return top recommendations
    sorted_spots = sorted(parking_freq.items(),
                         key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return sorted_spots[:3]
```
